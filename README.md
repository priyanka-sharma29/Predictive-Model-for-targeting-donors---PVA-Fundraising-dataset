# logisticregression-naivebayes
Using Logistic Regression (Ridge and Lasso), Naive Bayes, Boosted Trees to model fundraising dataset.

## Background
Develop model to improve the cost-effectiveness of direct marketing campaign for a fundraising organization. The overall response rate is 5.1%. Out of those who responded (donated), the average donation is $13.00. Each mailing costs $0.68 to produce and send. A sample of this dataset is taken to develop a classification model that can effectively capture donors so that the expected net profit is maximized. Weighted sampling is used, under-representing the non-responders so that the sample has a more balanced numbers of donors and non-donors.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
Data is cleaned and transformations are applied as required.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Different variables are exmained in terms of their distribution.

## Data Reduction
Using the technique of Principal Components Analysis, subset of variables collectively representing various categories are reduced into Principal Components.

## Data Modeling
Classification techniques of Decision Trees, Logistic Regression (using Ridge and Lasso), Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Boosted Trees are used to model the dependent variable (TARGET-B). Different parameter values are tested for each model to determine performance.
